# CIUS Extensibility

In PRIMAVERA ERP 10 is available a functionality that allows to convert sales documents, issued to customers who are public entities, in a document in XML format according to the Portuguese CIUS-PT model.
The generated model includes all mandatory fields for this communication and some optional fields.
However, it may not respond to all scenarios that may be needed by partners and customers, as there are other optional fields that were not included in the generated format.
This example shows how other optional fields can be added to the XML file, responding to these scenarios.
