# Extensibility

In this repository you will find information and code samples that allows you to understand how to use PRIMAVERA extensibility technology. This technology is the Visual Basic For Applications successor.

###  Extensibility Principle
In a ERP, extensibility is a tool that allows you to change the application business workflow or add extra business rules to implement your unique business processes.
The key to extensibility is that you can develop pieces of code that best fit you customer business process and create the necessary functionality for themselves.

With extensibility tools, you can:
1) Add to a entity user-defined fields and user-defined tables.
2) Change or add business rules at the user interface or API level.
3) Add new items to the application menu.
4) Add a new tab to an existing window.
